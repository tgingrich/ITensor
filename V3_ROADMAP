o Add conversion from QN ITensor to dense ITensor
o Define QDense * Dense contraction directly?
o Fix toExpH(AutoMPO) and toMPO(AutoMPO)
o Add back unit tests in autompo_test.cc that failed because ITensor{QDense}*ITensor{Dense} isn't defined
? New QN design:
  Store a smallstring along with QN value and mod fac. Storage is an array (fixed-size)
  of triples name-val-modfac.

o Change default behavior of MPS(sites) constructor
o Add randomMPS(sites,m) function (also perhaps randomMPS(InitState,m))

? Add back some removed prime functions, like prime(ITensor,Index,Index,...)

o Add read/write for TagSet
o Fix read/write for Index and test for rest of library
o Fix Heisenberg.h dependency for idmrg (or incorporate Anna's inf. AutoMPO pull request)
o Remove dependency of itensor/mps/localop.h in itensor/decomp.h (this seemed to be the only itensor/mps/ dependency left in itensor/)
o Update website:
  o Detailed documentation
  o ITensor book
  o Tutorials
  o Code formulas

# Final Release Checks
  o Fresh install with new options.mk file compiles
  o Jenkins is passing
  o All sample codes compile and run
  ? Incorporate sample codes into Jenkins/testing (I found the DMRG codes were useful for catching bugs, and TRG is a good test case for Tags)
  o All unit tests pass
